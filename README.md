# rtcg-portal-opncv
My weekly lab exercise for my course, Real-Time Computer Graphics. In this lab, I am using OpenCV to track hand movement and position. Then, the player are able to move into the portal and be transfered into a different world. In that new world, there is a simple minigame of throwing balls.
